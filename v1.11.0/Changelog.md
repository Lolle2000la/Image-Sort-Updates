# Changelog
* Fixed: Pressing the right or left arrow keys, while an item in the list of folders is selected, results in the list scrolling horizontally instead of skipping/moving the images.
* Fixed: Entering an empty folder allowed for moving and skipping, even through there is no image to skip/move.
* Fixed: Trying to "go back" on the first image results in skipping the image.
