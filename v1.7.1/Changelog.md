# Changelog
* Fixed: Asynchronous loading doesn't result in weird behavior through the data-races anymore (e.g. when opening a folder via right-click in the windows explorer).
* Fixed: Main window now disables all controls when loading to prevent accidental unwanted behavior.
* Fixed: The window indicating the progress made now isn't resizeable anymore and was generally polished up.
